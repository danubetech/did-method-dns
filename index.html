    <p>
        Many early DID methods were based on distributed ledgers or other decentralized infrastructure, and some of
        those still remain popular. However, the DID community has also seen a lot of innovation and has come up with
        new types of DID methods. One of them is <code>did:web</code>, which is based on traditional DNS and web
        server infrastructure. The DID method presented here is <code>did:dns</code>, which follows a similar
        idea but offers several improvements over <code>did:web</code>.

        <h2>
            Target system
        </h2>
        <p>
            The target system of the <code>did:dns</code> method is the Domain Name System (DNS), or more specifically,
            the set (or chain) of DNS zone files controlled by the authoritative DNS servers of the domain
            name that is the method-specific identifier in the DID.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>
            Method name
        </h2>
        <p>
            The method name that shall identify this DID method is: <code>dns</code>.

            A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
            <code>did:dns</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
            lowercase.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>
            Method-specific identifier
        </h2>
        <p>
            The method specific identifier is a fully qualified domain name.
            The formal rules describing valid domain name syntax are described in
            [[RFC1035]], [[RFC1123]], and [[RFC2181]].
        </p>
        <p>
            The domain name name may consist of an arbitrary number of subdomains.

            <p>
                Creating a DID is done by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Registering a domain name or subdomain via traditional means (e.g. using the services
                    of a domain name registrar, who in turn may use EPP or other protocols).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Configuring the domain name's authoritative DNS zone file to include Resource Records (RRs) following
                    the patterns described in the <a href="#resolve"></a> section.
                </li>

            <h3>
                Resolve
            </h3>
            <p>
                The following steps MUST be executed to resolve a DID to a DID document using the
                <code>did:dns</code> method.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create an empty DID document, called the <var>resolved DID document</var>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set the value of the <code>id</code> property of the <var>resolved DID document</var> to
                    the DID that is being resolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resolve the domain name in the DID's method-specific identifier to look up
                    Resource Records (RRs) associated with the domain name.
                    <p class="note">
                        This step SHOULD use DNSSEC and other security mechanisms. See
                        sections <a href="#relation-to-dnssec"></a> and
                        <a href="#security-and-privacy-considerations"></a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the domain name does not exist, the DID is considered to not exist either, and a
                    <code>notFound</code> error MUST be returned by the resolution process, as defined in
                    [[DID-CORE]].
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look up RRs matching the following conditions, and follow the corresponding rules to construct
                    the <var>resolved DID document</var>:

            Relation to the did:web method
        </h3>
        <p>
            Similar to this specification, [[?DID-WEB]] also defines a new DID method based on domain names. The syntax
            of the identifiers is equivalent with the exceptions that 1. the method name in this specification is
            <code>dns</code> instead of
            <code>web</code>, and 2. the <code>did:web</code> method also allows an optional colon-separated path
            component as part of its method-specific identifier, which is not supported by this specification. In terms
            of functionality, the main difference between the two methods is that while the <code>did:web</code>
            method requires both DNS and web infrastructure for its operation, the <code>did:dns</code> method requires
            only DNS infrastructure.

        <p>
            The [[?DID-IN-DNS]] specification also provides a way to connect existing DNS infrastructure with DIDs. It
            uses similar Resource Records (RRs). It
            however does not define a new DID method specification; rather, it defines a way for discovering a DID
            (using any DID method) from a domain name, using the DNS infrastructure and protocol. This is intended for
            use cases where a domain name is used for bootstrapping initial relationships or interactions, but the
            domain name is not intended to be used beyond such an initial step.

            Similar to [[?DID-IN-DNS]], the [[?WELL-KNOWN-DID]] specification also does not define a new DID method and
            is rather used for discovery of a DID using an existing domain name. It uses web server infrastructure
            in addition to DNS as the actual discovery mechanism.

        <h3>
            Relation to DKIM
        </h3>
        <p>
            This specification fulfills a similar purpose as DKIM insofar as it also associates public keys with
            domain names, using Resource Records (RRs). However, while DKIM is focused on a single use case
            (e-mail), this specification can be used with any service and protocol that supports DIDs.
        </p>
        <p>
            DKIM uses <strong>TXT</strong> RRs, while this DID method specification uses
            <strong>URI</strong> RRs.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be possible to define a DID method that uses DKIM keys directly in a DID document.
            However, in this DID method specification, we have chosen to keep DID document keys independent of
            DKIM keys.

        <h3>
            Relation to DNSSEC
        </h3>
        <p>
            Similar to this specification as well as DKIM, DNSSEC also associates public keys with domain names.
            DNSSEC does this for the purpose of securing the resolution process of domain names themselves.
            It is highly RECOMMENDED that DNSSEC is used when resolving domain names during the <a href="#resolve"></a>
            operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            DNSSEC uses <strong>DNSKEY</strong> RRs, while this DID method specification uses
            <strong>URI</strong> RRs.

        <p>

            DNS Security Considerations
        </h3>
        <p class="note" title="Applies similarly to did:web">
            This section was copied and adapted from the [[?DID-WEB]] specification, since
            similar considerations apply in both DID methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            DNS presents many of the attack vectors that enable active security and privacy
            attacks on the <code>did:dns</code> method, and it's important that implementors address these
            concerns via proper configuration of DNS. For example, without proper security
            of the DNS resolution via <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">DNS over HTTPS</a> it's possible for
            active attackers to intercept the result of the DNS resolution via a Man in the
            Middle attack which would point at a malicious server with the incorrect DID
            document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, implementors should be aware of issues presented by a Spoofed DNS
            records where the record returned by a malicious DNS Server is inauthentic and
            allows the record to be pointed at a malicious server which contains a different
            DID Document. To prevent this type of issue, usage of DNSSEC which is defined in
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033">RFC4033</a>,
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034">RFC4034</a>, and

            This section was copied and adapted from the [[?DID-WEB]] specification, since
            similar considerations apply in both DID methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the nature of the <code>did:dns</code> method relying upon a DNS in order to resolve
            the DID, all resolutions of a did:dns identifier have the potential to be
            tracked by a DNS provider. To mitigate the
            issue of the relying party being tracked when resolving the DID document, the
            relying party should look to either use a trusted Universal Resolver service to
            gain herd privacy, utilize a VPN service or perform a resolution over the TOR
            network. Another emerging solution that will be useful to address this is <a

            The DID operations defined in this specification do not provide an immutable history of changes that is
            typical for blockchain/DLT based DID methods, and which can be used for auditing purposes. This can lead
            to certain attacks where the DID document is manipulated temporarily, or different DID documents are
            presented to different resolvers, without an easy way to detect this behavior.

            DID Document Updates
        </h3>
        <p>
            Updates to a DID document may not be immediately visible to all resolvers, since standard DNS caching
            mechanisms (e.g. TTL values) apply.

        <h3>
            DID Document Deactivation
        </h3>
        <p>
            If a domain name is deleted, similar to when it is updated, the deletion may not be immediately visible,
            since standard DNS caching mechanisms (e.g. TTL values) apply.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases, if a domain name is deleted, grace periods may apply during which a domain name can be
            restored.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a domain is deleted, it may in the future be registered by another entity. This is known as the
            "identifier recycling problem". It means that it cannot be assumed that a DID is a persistent identifier
            for the same DID subject.

        <h3>
            Authorization of DID Operations
        </h3>
        <p>
            Unlike some other DID methods, this one does not use the DID document for
            authorization decisions of create/update/deactivate operations on the DID. This depends on
            authorization mechanisms of the underlying DNS infrastructure. In other words, the authority to update
            the domain name is linked to the authority to update the DID document.
